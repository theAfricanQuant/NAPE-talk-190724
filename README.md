Materials for NAPE talk given on Friday the 19th of July 2024 via zoom.

Topic: Understanding Machine Learning for Geosciences in the Age of AI.

Speaker: Ricky Sambo Macharm MScFE, Financial Data Scientist, Germany

Abstract
This presentation explores the transformative impact of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) on our way of life. We will introduce ML fundamentals, discuss linear regression
for mapping items from one domain to another and prediction, and cover classification
problems.
Additionally, we will explain neural networks, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for image recognition. Finally, we will highlight the applications of AI and Large
Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing geoscience data analysis and decision-making.
Attendees will gain insights into leveraging ML and AI to drive innovation and efficiency in
geosciences.
